## 🔁 Iteration 1 Retrospective

### ✅ What Went Well

- We successfully delivered the core features for the JCU Gym Management System, including **User Registration**, **Session Booking**, and **Admin User Management**, which formed the foundation of our platform.
- The team maintained a steady development pace throughout the sprint, supported by an effective GitHub workflow that helped streamline task assignments, issue tracking, and version control.
- Our selected tech stack (React.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL) proved to be well-integrated and allowed for rapid development without major compatibility issues.
- All planned deliverables were completed within our estimated effort of 32 person-days, aligning closely with our team’s velocity.

### 🛑 What Didn’t Go So Well

- The **Manage Bookings** feature took longer than anticipated and was still in progress toward the end of the iteration.
- We initially underestimated the complexity of implementing secure JWT authentication and role-based access control, which delayed some integration tasks.
- Testing for edge cases (e.g., duplicate session bookings or incorrect form inputs) was addressed later in the sprint, resulting in minor functional bugs that could have been caught earlier.

### 💡 Key Learnings & Action Items

- Breaking down larger user stories into **smaller, more manageable tasks** would improve clarity and allow for more precise progress tracking.
- UI/UX considerations were addressed late in the sprint. Going forward, we plan to allocate dedicated time for **interface refinement** earlier in the development cycle.
- To enhance quality and maintain momentum in future sprints, we will:
  - Prioritize backend-heavy features earlier in the timeline  
  - Introduce structured **test checklists** for each story  
  - Assign clearer ownership for security-critical features
