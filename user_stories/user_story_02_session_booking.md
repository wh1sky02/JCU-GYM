# User Story: Session Booking

**As a** gym user  
**I want** to browse available gym sessions and book a timeslot in advance  
**So that** I can plan my gym visits ahead of time  

---

## Priority: High  
**Rationale:** Core functionality that provides primary value to gym users and enables gym capacity management.

## Estimation: 4 days  
**Planning poker estimates:**
* Developer 1: 4 days (complex calendar interface)
* Developer 2: 3 days (booking logic)
* Developer 3: 5 days (including edge cases)
* **Consensus:** 4 days

## Assumptions:
- Gym operates on fixed time slots (e.g., hourly sessions)
- Each session has a maximum capacity limit
- Users can only book future sessions (not past dates)
- Booking requires user authentication

## Description:
The system will display available gym sessions in a calendar or list format, showing time, date, and available slots. Users can select and book sessions through an intuitive interface. The system must prevent overbooking and handle concurrent booking attempts.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Display list of sessions with time, date, and available slots
- [ ] Calendar or schedule view showing session availability
- [ ] Booking form connected to the authenticated user session
- [ ] Store booking details in the backend database
- [ ] Prevent double-booking the same timeslot for a user
- [ ] Prevent overbooking beyond session capacity
- [ ] Show real-time availability updates
- [ ] Booking confirmation with session details
- [ ] Handle concurrent booking attempts gracefully

## Tasks:

1. **Session Display Interface** - 1.5 days
   - Create calendar/schedule component
   - Display available sessions with capacity info
   - Implement filtering and navigation
   
2. **Booking Form & Logic** - 1.5 days
   - Create booking form with session details
   - Implement booking validation
   - Handle user authentication checks
   
3. **Backend Booking API** - 1 day

   - Set up booking confirmation logic
   
4. **Database & Real-time Updates** - 1 day
   - Design booking and session tables
   - Implement real-time availability updates
   - Add booking history tracking

# UI Design:
Booking interface should include:
- Clean calendar or list view of available sessions
- Clear indication of available/full sessions
- Easy-to-use booking form

- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

*Note: Insert mockup design screenshot showing calendar view and booking flow*

# Completed:

- [ ] Booking prevents overbooking scenarios
- [ ] Real-time updates working correctly
- [ ] Unit and integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance tested under concurrent load
- [ ] Code reviewed by team
