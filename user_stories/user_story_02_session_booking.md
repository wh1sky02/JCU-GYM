# 🧾 User Story: Session Booking

**As a** gym user  
**I want** to browse available gym sessions and book a timeslot in advance  
**So that** I can plan my gym visits ahead of time

---

## 🔺 Priority: High  
**Reason:** This is a key user-facing feature and essential for managing gym capacity effectively.

---

## 🧮 Estimation: 4 Days  
**Planning Poker Estimates:**  
- Developer 1: 4 days (complex calendar interface)  
- Developer 2: 3 days (booking logic)  
- Developer 3: 5 days (handling edge cases and concurrency)  
**→ Team Consensus:** 4 days

---

## 🔍 Assumptions

- Gym sessions run on fixed time slots (e.g., hourly)
- Each session has a maximum capacity limit
- Users can only book future sessions
- Booking requires the user to be logged in

---

## 📄 Description

Users will be able to view a list or calendar of upcoming gym sessions with available times and capacity. They can book a slot via a booking form linked to their account. The system must prevent overbooking, manage concurrent bookings, and provide real-time session availability.
