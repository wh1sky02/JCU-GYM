# User Story: Manage Bookings

**As a** gym user  
**I want** to view my upcoming bookings and cancel future sessions (not on the same day)  
**So that** I can manage my gym attendance more flexibly

---

## Priority: Medium  
**Rationale:** Enhances user experience by providing booking flexibility and reducing no-shows.

## Estimation: 3 days  
**Planning poker estimates:**
* Developer 1: 3 days (booking management interface)
* Developer 2: 2 days (basic cancellation logic)
* Developer 3: 4 days (including edge cases and notifications)
* **Consensus:** 3 days

## Assumptions:
- Users cannot cancel bookings on the same day of the session
- Cancelled slots become immediately available to other users
- Users receive confirmation of cancellations
- Cancellation history is maintained for analytics

## Description:
Provide users with a personal dashboard to view all their upcoming gym bookings and manage them efficiently. Users can cancel future bookings (except same-day) to free up slots for other users. The system must handle cancellation logic and update availability in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Display a list of all future bookings for the authenticated user
- [ ] Show booking details (date, time, session type, location)
- [ ] Cancel option available for bookings not on the same day
- [ ] Prevent cancellation of same-day bookings with clear messaging
- [ ] Successful cancellations update the system and release the slot
- [ ] User receives confirmation of cancellation
- [ ] Cancelled slots appear as available to other users immediately
- [ ] Maintain cancellation history for user reference
