# üßæ User Story: Manage Bookings

**As a** gym user  
**I want** to view my upcoming bookings and cancel future sessions (not on the same day)  
**So that** I can manage my gym attendance more flexibly

---

## üî∏ Priority: Medium  
**Reason:** Improves user autonomy and reduces session no-shows, contributing to better resource management.

---

## üßÆ Estimation: 3 Days  
**Planning Poker Estimates:**  
- Developer 1: 3 days (dashboard interface)  
- Developer 2: 2 days (cancellation logic)  
- Developer 3: 4 days (handling edge cases and feedback)  
**‚Üí Team Consensus:** 3 days

---

## üîç Assumptions

- Same-day cancellations are not allowed  
- Cancelled slots become immediately available to others  
- Users get a confirmation upon cancellation  
- Cancellations are logged for future analytics

---

## üìÑ Description

Users should be able to view their personal booking list and manage it through a simple interface. They can cancel any upcoming session, except those scheduled for the current day. The system should ensure real-time slot release, user confirmation, and a history view of past changes.
