# User Story: User Registration

**As a** new gym user  
**I want** to register securely online  
**So that** I can access gym facilities and services  

---

## Priority: High  
**Rationale:** Essential foundational feature required for all other system functionality.

## Estimation: 3 days  
**Planning poker estimates:**
* Developer 1: 3 days (frontend form + validation)
* Developer 2: 2 days (backend API + database)
* Developer 3: 4 days (security implementation)
* **Consensus:** 3 days

## Assumptions:
- Users will have valid JCU email addresses for verification
- Password security requirements are defined by university standards
- Database schema design is completed before implementation begins

## Description:
The web application will provide a secure registration form for new gym users (students and staff) to create accounts. The system must validate user credentials, ensure email uniqueness, and store user data securely for future login and booking activities.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Registration form includes Full Name, JCU Email, and Password fields
- [ ] Email validation ensures proper JCU domain format (@jcu.edu.au)
- [ ] Password strength validation (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- [ ] Password hashing and secure storage in database
- [ ] Registration confirmation message displayed after successful signup
- [ ] Duplicate email prevention with appropriate error message
- [ ] User data is stored securely in the system database
- [ ] Form validation provides real-time feedback to users

## Tasks:

1. **Frontend Registration Form** - 1 day
   - Create responsive registration form UI
   - Implement client-side validation
   - Add real-time feedback for form fields
   
2. **Backend API Development** - 1 day
   - Create user registration endpoint
   - Implement server-side validation
   - Set up password hashing (bcrypt)
   
3. **Database Integration** - 0.5 days
   - Design user table schema
   - Implement database connection and queries
   
4. **Security Implementation** - 0.5 days
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting for registration attempts
   - Security testing and validation

# UI Design:
Registration form should include:
- Clean, modern interface following JCU branding
- Clear field labels and validation messages
- Progress indicators for password strength
- Success/error state handling
- Mobile-responsive design

*Note: Insert mockup design screenshot using prototyping tools like [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)*

# Completed:
*Insert screenshots of completed implementation*
*Show different states: empty form, validation errors, success confirmation*

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed
- [ ] Code reviewed by team
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] UI/UX approved by stakeholders
