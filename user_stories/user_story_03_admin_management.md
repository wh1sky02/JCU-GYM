# User Story: Admin User Management

**As an** admin  
**I want** to view and manage registered gym users  
**So that** I can verify and control access to the gym system  

---

## Priority: High  
**Rationale:** Essential for maintaining gym security, verifying memberships, and managing user access.

## Estimation: 3 days  
**Planning poker estimates:**
* Developer 1: 3 days (admin dashboard complexity)
* Developer 2: 2 days (basic CRUD operations)
* Developer 3: 4 days (including security features)
* **Consensus:** 3 days

## Assumptions:
- Admin accounts are pre-created by system administrators
- Admin interface is separate from regular user interface
- User verification follows JCU's membership validation process
- Audit trail is required for admin actions

## Description:
Create a comprehensive admin dashboard that allows gym administrators to view all registered users, verify their eligibility, approve or reject registrations, and manage user access. The system must provide secure admin-only access and maintain logs of administrative actions.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Admin dashboard listing all registered users
- [ ] Display user details (name, email, registration date, status)
- [ ] Approve, reject, or deactivate user accounts
- [ ] Admin-only access via secure login
- [ ] Changes to user status reflect immediately in the database
- [ ] Search and filter users by various criteria
- [ ] Pagination for large user lists
- [ ] Audit trail of admin actions
- [ ] Bulk actions for managing multiple users

## Tasks:

1. **Admin Authentication & Security** - 1 day
   - Create admin login system

4. **Audit & Logging System** - 0.5 days
   - Set up admin action logging
   - Create audit trail display
   - Implement change history tracking

- [ ] Admin security properly implemented
- [ ] All user management actions working correctly
- [ ] Audit logging functional
- [ ] Unit and integration tests passing
- [ ] Security testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed by team
