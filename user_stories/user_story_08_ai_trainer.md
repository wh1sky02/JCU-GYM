# User Story: AI Workout Trainer

**As a** gym user  
**I want** personalized workout recommendations  
**So that** I can improve my training results and achieve my fitness goals

---

## Priority: Low  
**Rationale:** Advanced feature that provides significant value but requires substantial development effort and is not essential for core gym management.

## Estimation: 5 days  
**Planning poker estimates:**
* Developer 1: 5 days (AI integration complexity)
* Developer 2: 4 days (recommendation engine)
* Developer 3: 6 days (including machine learning components)
* **Consensus:** 5 days

## Assumptions:
- AI service integration is available (OpenAI API, custom ML model, or similar)
- User fitness data collection is implemented
- Workout database/library exists
- Privacy and data protection requirements are defined

## Description:
Develop an AI-powered workout trainer that provides personalized exercise recommendations based on user preferences, fitness level, goals, and available equipment. The system should adapt recommendations over time based on user feedback and progress tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] User profile includes fitness goals, experience level, and preferences
- [ ] AI generates personalized workout plans based on user data
- [ ] Recommendations consider available gym equipment and session duration
- [ ] Progressive difficulty adjustment based on user feedback
- [ ] Exercise instructions and demonstration videos/images
- [ ] Workout history tracking and progress monitoring
- [ ] Ability to rate and provide feedback on workouts
- [ ] Integration with booking system for session-specific recommendations

## Tasks:

1. **User Profile & Data Collection** - 1 day
   - Create fitness profile setup interface
   - Implement user goal and preference tracking
   - Design data collection workflows
   
2. **AI Service Integration** - 2 days
   - Integrate with AI/ML service provider
   - Develop recommendation algorithm
   - Implement workout generation logic
   
3. **Workout Interface & Tracking** - 1.5 days
   - Create workout display interface
   - Implement exercise instruction system
   - Add progress tracking functionality
   
4. **Feedback & Adaptation System** - 0.5 days
   - Implement workout rating system
   - Create feedback collection interface
   - Set up recommendation refinement logic

# UI Design:
AI trainer interface should include:
