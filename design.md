# JCU Gym Management System - Design Documentation

## Project Overview

The JCU Gym Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline gym operations for James Cook University Singapore's fitness center. The system provides user registration, session booking, admin management, and billing functionality.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4 with React and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server-side functionality
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon cloud hosting
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing

### Database Design

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![ERD Final](ERD_final.png)

The database schema consists of the following core entities:

- **Users**: Student and admin accounts with membership details
- **Sessions**: Gym session scheduling with capacity management
- **Bookings**: User session reservations with status tracking
- **Reminders**: Automated notification system
- **Gym Tour**: Virtual tour management for new users
- **Admins**: Administrator access control
- **Cancellations**: Booking cancellation tracking

#### Key Relationships
- Users have one-to-many relationships with Bookings
- Sessions have one-to-many relationships with Bookings
- Bookings can have associated Reminders and Cancellations
- Admins manage Users, Sessions, and system configuration

- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Secure authentication middleware

#### UI/UX Design
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture using shadcn/ui
- Consistent JCU branding and theming

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based access control for admin functions

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Privacy Compliance
- Secure handling of personal information
- GDPR-compliant data storage and processing
- User consent management for data collection

## Performance Optimization

### Database Performance
- Indexed columns for frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling to reduce overhead
- Optimized query patterns with proper joins

### Frontend Performance
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Component lazy loading
- Optimized bundle size with code splitting

### Scalability Features
- Cloud-based database hosting with Neon
- Stateless API design for horizontal scaling
- Efficient caching strategies

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- Git-based version control with GitHub
- Feature branch workflow
- Comprehensive commit messaging

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Component testing and validation

### Deployment Strategy
- Development environment with hot reloading
- Staging environment for testing
- Production deployment with environment-specific configurations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
